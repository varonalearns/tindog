## Overview

### The challenge

#### Requirements:

- Follow the design spec
- Use JavaScript classes
- Use modules (import/export)

### Links

- Solution URL: [Github Repo](https://github.com/varonalearns/tindog)
- Live Site URL: [Netlify Live Site](https://tindog-evarona.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
There was a lot that I learned here. For instance, I learned about how to remove and add HTML elements through JavaScript. I am particularly happy about the following code:

``` javascript
function likeBtn() {
    document.getElementById("dog").insertAdjacentHTML('beforebegin', `
        <div class="decision-img">
            <img src="/images/badge-like.png" alt="liked">
        </div>`)
    reset()

    setTimeout(()=>{
        nextDog()
    }, 750) 
}
```

I used my understanding of HTML and JavaScript to find a solution to my issue on my own. That I am really proud about.

### Continued development
In the future, I definitely want to add some more features to this project. Perhaps a dark-mode feature.
